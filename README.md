# Hey, I'm Raif 👋

I'm a curious builder with a passion for design, development, and developer experience. I work on clean UIs, technical documentation, and web apps that are easy to use and easy to scale.

## 🛠 What I Do
- I develop web applications using **Flask**, **Vue.js**, **Nuxt**, and **Astro** for fast, marketing-friendly sites.
- I’m exploring the intersection of **design systems**, **frontend engineering**, and **developer documentation**.
- Currently diving deep into **JavaScript**, **React**, and **Tailwind CSS** through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

## 📚 What I'm Learning
- Advanced web development workflows (design-to-code, DX, component libraries)
- Building UI systems with **Storybook**, **shadcn/ui**, and **Radix UI**
- Contributing to open source via docs, guides, and tutorials

## 🚀 Recent Projects
- 🧠 [MemoMind](https://memo-mind.vercel.app) – a Buildspace project for mood tracking with a simple UI and journaling flow (Database not live anymore) 
- 🌤️ Productivity Tracker with weather & mood context ([Buffalogs - GitHub](https://github.com/raif-sh/buffalogs))

## 💬 Let’s Connect
I'm open to collaborations, freelance projects, or just geeking out about frontend, DX, or writing great docs.
