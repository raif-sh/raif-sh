# Hey, I’m Raif 👋

Product-oriented technologist with a background in **marketing, growth, and product development**.

I’ve worked close to the problem space — translating user needs, business goals, and constraints into clear product direction, scalable interfaces, and thoughtful execution.

## What I bring
- Product thinking, discovery, and roadmap clarity
- UX, design systems, and frontend execution
- Strong written communication (docs, specs, narratives)
